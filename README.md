# RNASeq
This is our CSE 185 Project that performs differential gene expression analysis on RNA-seq data. Our implementation includes processing and normalizing the RNA-seq count data and statistical testing to identify any significant genes that have significantly different levels of expression. The tool also includes graphical outputs of volcano plots and MA-plots. We modeled this tool around the DESeq2 R package for differential expression analysis using python rather than R.

# RNASeq
This is our CSE 185 Project that performs differential gene expression analysis on RNA-seq data. Our implementation includes processing and normalizing the RNA-seq count data and statistical testing to identify any significant genes that have significantly different levels of expression. The tool also includes graphical outputs of volcano plots, umap plots, and heatmaps. We modeled this tool around the DESeq2 R package for differential expression analysis using python rather than R.

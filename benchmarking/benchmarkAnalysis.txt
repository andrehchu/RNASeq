    We benchmarked pySeqDiff against Deseq2 by running both software with RNA Seq count data for the cell line 
kyse150 from a txt file available in the paper KDM2A plays a dual role in regulating the expression of 
malignancy-related genes in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Like DESeq2, the output of pySeqDiff indicates 
that there are genes that are differentially expressed in our dataset that are statistically significant (p<0.05). 
Our output also indicates that there are genes that are not differentially expressed with significance, which 
indicates that our tool is not considering every gene significant.
    Among the top five most significant differentially expressed genes ordered by smallest p-value, we found one gene 
that was reported by both pySeqDiff and DESeq2. This indicates that our tool is at least on the right track of 
correctly identifying differential expression. Additionally, within the context of the study the dataset was sourced 
from, gene 7057 is related to tumor growth. This means that our tool is able to identify that KDM2A likely has a role 
in the regulation of oncogenesis, which was the conclusion of the original study. Our tool identified that gene 7057 
is downregulated by KDM2A, while DESeq2 identified gene 7057 as upregulated by KDM2A. This difference is not very 
relevant as due to our knowledge from the study, KDM2A is responsible for both the up and down regulation of tumor 
growth genes, and therefore we are unable to determine which tool is correct.
    Looking at the visualization of the output data using volcano plots, we can see that pySeqDiff did not identify 
as many significantly differentially expressed genes as DESeq2 did. We hypothesize that this might be due to DESeq2 
better handling of dispersion, as well as the accuracy of their statistical testing.
